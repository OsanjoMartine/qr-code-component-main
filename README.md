## My process
1. Downloaded the starter files
2. Extracted the files
3. Opened the files on vs code
4. Built structure first with html
5. Added styling to the markdown.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

* I learnt that images have default dispay as inline-block so sometimes they will have padding at the bottom, you can remove this by setting the font-size and line-height of the image holder element to 0;

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class=image-holder>
  <img src="images/image.jpg" class="image"/>
</div>
```
```css
.image-holder {
  font-size:0;
  line-height:0;
  background: red;
}
```
The color is just to see the content box of the div.
